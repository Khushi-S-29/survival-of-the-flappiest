## Survival of the Flappiest

This project demonstrates **neuroevolution** by combining a
**neural network and genetic algorithm implemented entirely from scratch**
to solve a real-time control problem.

Birds learn to play a Flappy Bird–like game through population-based evolution.

Learning emerges through **evolutionary selection**: better-performing
neural networks survive longer, are selected as parents, and produce
mutated offspring for the next generation.
